### Hello, welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Frank LaÃ©rcio, a computer science student trying to balance:

- Work
- University studies
- Family time
- Gym
- Collecting vintage video games
- Golang studies
- A collection of mugs

All this while a knack for easily learning useless things.

Here you will find my projects, ranging from distributed systems to experiments with new technologies. Feel free to explore, collaborate, and share ideas!
