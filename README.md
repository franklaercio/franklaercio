I am a combination of a bold dreamer and an explorer in search of new challenges. My journey revolves around coding and simplifying the lives of millions of people around the world. I have worked with and studied various programming languages such as Java, C, Go, Python, and JavaScript, but the majority of my time has been dedicated to working with Java.

I take pride in my involvement in significant professional, academic, and personal projects. Some of them have changed the way I perceive the world and continue to inspire me to dream of new challenges every day.

I thrive in team environments, where I can contribute to innovative solutions. I am also not afraid to take on tasks that even more experienced developers may hesitate to tackle.
